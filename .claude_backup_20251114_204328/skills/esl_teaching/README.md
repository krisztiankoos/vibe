# ESL Teaching Methodology Skill

## Quick Reference

Expert knowledge of English as a Second Language teaching using communicative, student-centered approaches (PPP/TTT methodology). This skill helps create pedagogically sound English lessons that follow ESL best practices for CEFR levels A1-C2.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:

- Create complete English language lessons using PPP or TTT framework
- Design communicative activities that promote fluency
- Develop controlled practice exercises for grammar accuracy
- Select or adapt authentic materials for English learners
- Create level-appropriate content (CEFR A1-C2)
- Design information gap activities and role-plays
- Plan student-centered, interaction-rich lessons

## When NOT to Use This Skill

Don't use this skill for:

- Teaching English literature to native speakers
- Academic essay writing (needs different approach)
- Ukrainian language lessons (use Ukrainian Teaching Skill instead)
- Translation tasks (languages are taught separately)

## How to Invoke

Activate this skill naturally when working on English lesson design:

```
"Create a B1 PPP lesson on present perfect for life experiences, 60 minutes"
```

```
"Design communicative activities for A2 students learning how to give directions"
```

```
"I need controlled practice exercises for past simple vs. present perfect at B1 level"
```

## Example Workflows

### 1. Create a Complete ESL Lesson

**Task**: Teacher needs a full lesson for intermediate students

**Invocation**:
```
Create a 60-minute B1 lesson on making suggestions (could, should, how about, why don't we).
Use PPP framework with communicative production activities.
```

**Output**:
- Lead-in: Photos of problems, elicit suggestions
- Presentation: Dialogue showing suggestion structures in context
- Controlled Practice: Gap-fill, multiple choice, matching exercises
- Free Practice: Information gap (Plan a weekend trip), role-play (Solve friend's problem)
- Teacher notes: Anticipated errors, pronunciation tips
- Answer keys for all exercises

### 2. Design Information Gap Activity

**Task**: Need communicative pair work for practicing questions

**Invocation**:
```
Create an information gap activity for A2 students practicing Wh-questions about daily routines.
Student A and Student B each have different information.
```

**Output**:
- Student A card: Has information about Person 1's routine
- Student B card: Has information about Person 2's routine
- Students ask questions to complete missing information
- Clear instructions for pairing and monitoring
- Example questions provided

### 3. Adapt Authentic Material

**Task**: Make real-world text appropriate for learners

**Invocation**:
```
Adapt this BBC article about remote work for B2 students.
Focus on reported speech structures. Include pre-reading, comprehension, and vocabulary exercises.
```

**Output**:
- Pre-reading: Discussion questions to activate knowledge
- Adapted text (simplified but authentic-feeling)
- Comprehension questions (3 levels: literal, inferential, evaluative)
- Vocabulary matching (words from text)
- Grammar focus: Find examples of reported speech
- Production: "Report what your partner said about their ideal job"

## Key Principles

### Communicative Approach
- Language learned through meaningful interaction
- Focus on fluency, not just accuracy
- Real-world contexts and authentic materials
- Students do most of the talking

### PPP Framework
1. **Presentation**: Introduce language in context (don't lecture)
2. **Practice**: Controlled exercises building to freer practice
3. **Production**: Communicative tasks with real outcomes

### Level-Appropriate Content
- A1-A2: Concrete, everyday topics, visual support
- B1-B2: Abstract concepts, opinions, complex situations
- C1-C2: Nuance, idioms, authentic professional/academic texts

## Common Exercise Types

**Controlled (Accuracy)**:
- Gap-fill: `I ___ (never/be) to Japan.` → `I've never been to Japan.`
- Multiple choice: Choose correct form
- True/False: Check comprehension

**Guided (Accuracy + Fluency)**:
- Information gap: Exchange missing information using target language
- Sentence scramble: Put words in order
- Matching: Connect related items (collocations, definitions)

**Free (Fluency)**:
- Role-play: Simulate real situations
- Discussion: Express and defend opinions
- Problem-solving: Collaborate to find solution

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Too Much Grammar Explanation
Students need to *use* language, not just understand rules. Keep explanations brief.

### ❌ Teacher Talking Too Much
If teacher talks 80% of the lesson, students aren't learning. Aim for Student Talking Time > 70%.

### ❌ No Clear Context
Don't start with "Today we're learning conditionals." Show a context first, elicit the language.

### ❌ Only One Exercise Type
Mix controlled and free practice. Don't do 50 minutes of gap-fills.

## Tips for Success

1. **Context First**: Always introduce language in a meaningful situation
2. **Elicit, Don't Tell**: Ask questions to draw out student knowledge
3. **Controlled → Free**: Start with accuracy practice, move to fluency
4. **Authentic Materials**: Use real articles, videos, podcasts when possible
5. **Pairwork**: Maximize speaking opportunities with pair/group activities
6. **Error Correction**: Gentle during fluency tasks, direct during accuracy practice

## Sample Lesson Outline

**B1 - Present Perfect for Life Experiences (60 min)**

| Stage | Time | Activity | Aim |
|-------|------|----------|-----|
| Lead-in | 5 min | Show photos of exotic locations, elicit "Have you been to...?" | Activate prior knowledge |
| Presentation | 10 min | Read dialogue about travel, highlight present perfect | Introduce target language in context |
| Controlled Practice | 15 min | Gap-fill, multiple choice, sentence transformation | Build accuracy |
| Guided Practice | 15 min | Information gap: Find someone who has... | Practice with support |
| Free Practice | 12 min | Role-play: Job interview talking about life experiences | Communicate freely |
| Wrap-up | 3 min | Quick review, error correction, homework | Consolidate learning |
